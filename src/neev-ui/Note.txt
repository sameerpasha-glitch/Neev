Just a Note on overall website :-

    1.Responsiveness Issue:

        The neehq website is beautifully built, but its responsiveness needs improvement, as it appears oversized on certain devices.
        Added Features in My Project:

    2.Top-back Button: Added a top-back button, which is a current trend.
        Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Implemented a toggle for switching between dark and light modes.
        Email Section Update:

    3.Removed the "waiting list" button in the email section.
        Replaced it with a "subscribe" button to notify users of new feature releases.
    
    4.Future Ideas:
        Search Bar with Microphone for Scheduling Dates: Had the idea of integrating a search bar where users can use the microphone to schedule dates. However, I feel it's a bit advanced for now and plan to learn more about it in the future.
        Scheduled Dates and Hospital Location Feature: Thought of adding a feature for hospital location related to scheduled dates but plan to implement this after the appointment functionality.
        Progress and Learning:

** 
It was really a great opportunity to redesign your website for me and though the website is beautifully designed and well-built, creating a visually appealing user experience.

as a beginner, Iâ€™ve managed to achieve this & eager to continue learning and contributing more in the future.
