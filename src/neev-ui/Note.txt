/*
 * Note on overall website:
 *
 * 1. Responsiveness Issue:
 *    - The neehq website is beautifully built, but its responsiveness needs improvement, as it appears oversized on certain devices.
 *
 * 2. Added Features in My Project:
 *    - Top-back Button: Added a top-back button, which is a current trend.
 *    - Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Implemented a toggle for switching between dark and light modes.
 *    - Email Section Update: Removed the "waiting list" button in the email section and replaced it with a "subscribe" button to notify users of new feature releases.
 *
 * 3. Future Ideas:
 *    - Search Bar with Microphone for Scheduling Dates: Idea of integrating a search bar where users can use the microphone to schedule dates. Plan to learn more about it in the future.
 *    - Scheduled Dates and Hospital Location Feature: Thought of adding a feature for hospital location related to scheduled dates but plan to implement this after the appointment functionality.
 *    - Chat bot feature to help the user interact.
 *
 * My Project Drawbacks:
 *    - Did not implement a responsive design due to time constraints and limited knowledge of cross-browser compatibility. Actively working on improving these skills to enhance future projects.
 *
 * Note:
 *    - It was a great opportunity to redesign the website. Although the website is beautifully designed and well-built, creating a visually appealing user experience.
 *    - As a beginner, Iâ€™ve managed to achieve this and am eager to continue learning and contributing more in the future.
